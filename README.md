# todo-list
- https://kora-ai.github.io/todo-list/
- this is a simple program which only featuring the main functions of todo list
- the purpose is only to practice Vue.js, so the program is without any CSS design.
- Vue.js/ HTML5 
- use array to add/delete options
# Instruction
- Type a todo in the field
- Press Enter key
- Click Delete link to delete the todo
# My thinking
- Create a empty array called todolist and a string called todo, which the array is composed of many todos.
- Create a method to add string to array using array.push
- Create a method to delete string by using array splice.

# Update
- 2022/11/25 Add a constraint to the input-->When the input is empty, it will not be added to the array
